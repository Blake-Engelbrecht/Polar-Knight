# **Polar Knight**
---

## Description:
    Donkey Kong Country inspired 2D-platformer. Player starts on left-most
    part of the map and must reach the right-most part to win. Player will need to 
    navigate obstacles, such as platform jumps, and avoid or defeat enemies in order
    to reach the end of the level. Along the way the player can collect coins
    scattered throughout the map to increase their total score. (going to think of 
    a more creative thematic description about how our wintery soldier 
    must travel across the tundra and reach Valhalla or something eventually)
